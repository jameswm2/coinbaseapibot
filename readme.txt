Hi

I created this script for people looking to try to automate coinbase trading.
It's just a basic API caller that processes datasets and creates decisions from that processed data

I want to add SQL data dumping of the API calls for ML learning downstream, as well as implement a more streamlined pandas_ta call where you can pick and choose indicators to trade from.
